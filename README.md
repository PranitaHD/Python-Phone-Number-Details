# Python-Phone-Number-Details
Language :- Python Programming. The program gives the detail of a phone number entered by the user. At very first, you will be asked to enter a number with it's country code for example "+9178XXXXXXXX". After hitting the enter button, basic details of the mobile number will be displayed. I have used Visual Studio Code here.
